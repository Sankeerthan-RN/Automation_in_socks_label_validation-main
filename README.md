# Automation_in_socks_label_validation-main
 This is a project for socks card label validation where the socks card is validated comparing with the correct socks card whose coordinates are stored in the database. When the test socks card is compared with the correct socks card(master socks card) the software checks whether both test and master socks card matches or not.
